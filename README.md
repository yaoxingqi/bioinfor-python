# bioinfor-python
I am a new comer in Github, so I just try to do something of my own to contribute to my career --bioinformation.
As for this respository, I aimed to copy small programs (maybe several lines) from practical sessions for Algorithms for DNA Sequencing.
In this respository, programs are saved in ipython, howerever, I am not familiar with ipython, I got many mistakes, espesially in WIN32 POWERSHELL, so I tried to edit them to adapt to a file can run as a normal programs. Maybe I was too low to use python, but at least I tried. So, that's it!
